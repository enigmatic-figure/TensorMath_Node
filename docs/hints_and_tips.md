# Hints and Tips

Already comfortable with the basics? The ideas below help you squeeze more control out of Prompt Math expressions.

## Blend Strategically

- **Normalise weights mentally.** Expressions are evaluated exactly as written, so `[[ [cat] + [dog] ]]` is equivalent to a 50/50 blend. Scale terms explicitly when you want bias (`[[ 0.8 * [cat] + 0.2 * [dog] ]]`).
- **Subtract with care.** Negative weights are powerful but can amplify noise. When subtracting `[trees]` from a forest scene, clamp the result with `NormalizationOperations` downstream if artifacts appear.

## Pair Schedules for Narrative Control

- **Crossfades:** Use complementary `fade_in` and `fade_out` schedules on two tokens to create cinematic transitions.
- **Pulses:** Register a custom pulse schedule to create rhythmic emphasis (great for music-video style prompts). Combine it with multiplication to modulate only a subset of the expression.
- **Envelope Stacking:** Multiple schedules on the same token multiply together. Chain a `fade_in` with a short emphasis burst to get a rapid highlight at a precise moment.

## Manage Token Libraries

- Store embeddings in a dedicated `Python` node or load them from disk so they are easy to reuse across flows.
- Cache heavy embeddings with ComfyUI's save/load nodes to avoid recomputing encodes.
- Keep a neutral or blank embedding (`pad`) on hand so the evaluator never has to fall back to zeros unintentionally.

## Inspect Schedule Output

- The `schedule_payload` output is JSON-friendly. Plug it into a `Python` node and print the contents while iterating through the diffusion timeline to understand how weights evolve.
- When debugging custom schedules, feed the payload into `ScheduleEvaluator` manually to confirm values at specific timesteps.

## Compose with Other Nodes

- Combine TensorMath with control nets or LoRA loaders: generate conditioning with TensorMath, then mix it with LoRA modifiers using downstream math nodes.
- Use TensorMath in latent image-to-image chains to keep prompt emphasis aligned with image strength schedules.

## Keep the Front-End in Sync

- Any time you add or modify schedules in Python, regenerate the config and clear browser caches. Inconsistent metadata is the most common cause of UI glitches.
- If you ship TensorMath as part of a larger custom node pack, ensure the `web/` folder is copied verbatim so the editor assets remain available.

Experiment, iterate, and document the expressions that work best for youâ€”sharing those recipes back with the community helps everyone build stronger prompt libraries.
